    My dissertation Adverbial adjectives and nominal scalarity investigates scalarity in the nominal domain through the study of a subset of prenominal adverbial adjectives in Spanish, adjectives of veracity (AVs; verdadero ‘true’, auténtico ‘authentic’) and adjectives of completeness (ACs; completo ‘complete’, total ‘total’, absoluto ‘absolute’). Zooming out, it deals with the values associated with prenominal position in Romance, the parallelism between adverbial and adjectival modification, and the manifestations of scalarity in nouns.  
  Hi! I'm a linguist primarily interested in the study of meaning from its logical and pragmatic sides. My main focus is modification and its interaction with vagueness, scalarity and evaluative meaning. Right now I'm learning about computational linguistics and trying to combine it with my background in formal semantics.
At the moment I’m working as an Associate Linguist at Google Spain (through Adecco Outsourcing). The last two years I’ve been a lecturer at the <a href="https://www.ucm.es/lengespyteoliter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">department of Spanish Linguistics and Literary Theory</a> at the <a href="http://www.ucm.es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universidad Complutense de Madrid</a>. 
I did my PhD in formal semantics at the Linguistics and Cognitive Science research group (LyCC) at the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) in Madrid, and at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB). My dissertation Adverbial adjectives and nominal scalarity investigates scalarity in the nominal domain through the study of a subset of prenominal adverbial adjectives in Spanish, adjectives of veracity (AVs; verdadero ‘true’, auténtico ‘authentic’) and adjectives of completeness (ACs; completo ‘complete’, total ‘total’, absoluto ‘absolute’). Zooming out, it deals with the values associated with prenominal position in Romance, the parallelism between adverbial and adjectival modification, and the manifestations of scalarity in nouns.
You can find my research on this site, as well as my CV, and I'll add some slides from my lectures.

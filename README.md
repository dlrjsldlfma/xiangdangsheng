# Notes

I'm a mediocre developer hacking away at hard problems.
Whenever I figure something out, I write a note to myself so
when I inevitably have the same problem in the future, I'll have a reference.

I've been doing this for years, locally,
but just recently started pushing notes to a repo.

## Jekyll Theme

Lanyon is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

          Maximizers (<i>completely</i>, <i>fully</i>) are degree modifiers sensitive to the scale structure of the adjective they combine with. Spanish adjectives of 
          completeness (<i>completo</i> ‘complete’, <i>total</i> ‘total’) show a distribution similar to that of their adverbial counterparts when modifying property concept 
          [PC] nouns (<i>libertad</i> ‘freedom’, <i>sabiduría</i> ‘wisdom’). This paper argues that adjectives of completeness are degree modifiers in the nominal domain. In 
          order to do so, it adopts a semantics of PC nouns as denoting substances, following Francez and Koontz-Garboden (2015), which can be bounded or unbounded, just like 
          their related adjectives (<i>libre</i> ‘free’, etc.). Establishing a strong parallelism between adverbs and adjectives of completeness contributes to the understanding 
          of scalarity across categories and the relation between degrees and measurements.

          Aspectual modifiers that have adverbial and adjectival counterparts are an important source of information for researching lexical aspect in the nominal domain. One 
          class of such modifiers are adverbs of completeness (<i>completamente</i> 'completely', <i>totalmente</i> 'totally'), which are maximizers when modify adjectives, and 
          their correspondent adjectives (<i>completo</i> ‘complete’, <i>total</i> ‘total’). This paper addresses the inheritance of aspectual features and its relation to 
          degree in event nominalizations of incremental theme verbs (<i>traducción</i> 'translation', <i>destrucción</i> 'destruction') through the analysis of the modification 
          performed by adjectives of completeness in Spanish. The proposal combines a syntactic account of deverbal nominalizations with a scalar approach to aspect. Adjectives 
          of completeness are argued to be aspectual modifiers, with a contribution equivalent to that of their adverbial counterparts both in the verbal and in the adjectival 
          domain, establishing thus a parallelism between degree modification of adjectives, verbs and nominals.

        <p>Evaluative nouns (ENs, <i>idiota</i> ‘idiot’, <i>matasanos</i> ‘quack’) do not only assign a property, but also express a value judgment. A degree analysis (Bolinger 
          1972, Matushansky 2002, Morzycki 2009) encounters some problems, such as the controversial status of nominal gradability and the relation between gradability and value 
          judgment. By focusing on Spanish data, this study shows that the defining element for ENs is an expressive component of meaning and that these nouns may vary on their 
          gradability and the target of their expressive meaning. Based on this, a typology of ENs is established. In doing so, this paper contributes to the understanding of 
          evaluativity and the connection between gradability and subjectivity in the nominal domain.

        Maximizers (<i>completamente</i> ‘completely’, <i>totalmente</i> ‘totally’) are degree modifiers restricted to maximum standard adjectives. Spanish adjectives of 
          completeness [ACs] (<i>completo</i> ‘complete’, <i>total</i> ‘total’) display a behavior similar to that of their adverbial counterparts when they combine with nouns 
          like <i>idiot</i>. This paper argues that ACs are maximality modifiers of <i>idiot</i>-like nouns, which are defended to be gradable and denote extreme degrees of 
          properties. Establishing a parallelism between adverbs and adjectives of completeness allows us to explore scalarity across categories and the relevance of scale 
          structure in the nominal domain.

        This paper discusses adjectives of veracity in Spanish (<i>verdadero</i> ‘true’ or <i>auténtico</i> ‘authentic’), which are intensifiers in prenominal position. I will 
          argue that AVs are sensitive to the vagueness of the predicate and propose an analysis of AVs as domain restrictors that builds on Sassoon (2013).

        The aim of this paper is to offer an analysis of adjectives of veracity in Spanish (<i>verdadero</i> ‘true’ or <i>auténtico</i> ‘authentic’) that accounts for their 
          modification of nouns in terms of imprecision regulation. Slack regulators are elements that signal the intended degree of precision in the use of an expression to 
          describe a situation. In order to account for this fact, I will adopt Morzycki’s (2011) framework, which allows to directly compare and modify degrees along a scale 
          of imprecision. Under this framework, expressions denote sets of alternatives whose size depends on the degree of precision of the context. <i>Verdadero</i> and 
          <i>auténtico</i> are argued to be degree modifiers affecting this scale of imprecision by setting the degree of precision of the context to a high value, forcing the 
          modified noun to be interpreted in a strict sense.

        This study focuses on the so-called «adjetivos adverbiales marcadores de la intensión» (Demonte, 1999) [Quirk's «intensifying adjectives»] in Spanish. These, unlike 
          qualifying adjectives and those derived from nouns, affect on the intension of nouns whether intensifying or prototyping them. Putting forward a syntactic and 
          semantic characterization of three of these adjectives –<i>mero</i>, <i>puro</i> and <i>completo</i>–, the scarce literature available on this topic is critically 
          studied in order to highlight its precision or inaccuracy and, hence, the need for a new explanation. Finally, some unresolved issues are pointed out for future 
          researches.

I have been selected for GSoC'16! The results came out on Apr 23, and I have never been happier! I got around to writing this blog post only now, because of my end semester examinations which ended yesterday. I have been alotted [Isuru](https://github.com/isuruf) and [Sumith](https://github.com/sumith1896) as my official mentors. I'm very excited to start working on the project, alongside them.

Right now, I'll start my discussions on the implementation details, and overall structure of the code. Also I will begin work on the Fast Fourier algorithm for univariate polynomial multiplication.

Looking forward to a busy summer!

Today I've been thinking of what I'm grateful for. This week I've been really thankful for service. I have had the wonderful blessing of serving a lot of people. It's such a blessing to see them happy and know that it meant a lot to them. I'm also thankful for those people who have helped me out, served me when I've been struggling a little bit this week. It's such a blessing to have good friends and good people in life.

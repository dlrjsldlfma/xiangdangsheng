I'm so thankful for the Book of Mormon because it's helped me throughout my life whether helping me solve my problems or bringing me peace.

I had a decision to make today. I was reading in the scriptures and found help and encouragement on how to receive an answer to my question. There was a prophet in the scriptures named Mormon and he had a problem. His process helped me with my problem.

He records in Moroni 8:7
> For immediately after I had learned these things of you [Moroni] I inquired of the Lord concerning the matter.

Mormon after finding a problem immediately inquired, or asked of the Lord. "And the word of the Lord came to me by the power of the Holy Ghost…" (verse 7)

Mormon had received personal revelation from God and he now knew.

Verse 9:
> And after this manner did the Holy Ghost manifest the word of God unto me; wherefore, my beloved son, I know…

Mormon inquired and knew. After reading that, I did what I knew which was to "counsel with the Lord" (Alma 37:37). I then used what Mormon taught. I received my answer. I knew and so can you.

title: Learning Git
---

By virtue of GitHub's sheer ubiquity, I've gotten some amount of exposure to Git in the last few months (see: this blog). However, there's only so much learning-by-fumbling that I'm willing to put myself through, and after a certain point, I prefer to know how to do things properly. Enter Udacity's free course on [How to Use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775), which I completed this week. <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

I had previously been under the impression that GitHub was a public dumping ground for people to showcase their code. I knew that it kept a version history of all files, but so what? A lot of web services, like Dropbox, do the same thing. But now - now I know about the existence of Git and, on a basic level, how to use it. It's the version control system I subconsciously wanted but never knew existed.

Put briefly, Git is an offline version control system that stores an annotated version history for a given set of documents. Unlike other systems that save versions automatically, the Git user is empowered to decide what constitutes a complete version. From my perspective, this is great for two reasons: first, I can get a snapshot of version history for several related files at once. Second, I have _full control over what gets saved and how_. No managing multiple versions of the same file called "Draft 1," "Draft 2," "Final with comments," ever again. I can edit a single file and simply commit major changes using Git for future reference. As someone who regularly reorganizes the folder structure on my computer, I am incredibly pleased with this new knowledge. Last night, I transferred my Scrabble Solver files into a Git repository. I had several different versions of the program (labeled 0, 1, 2...) saved on my computer, and those four files are now collapsed into a single Git log. I fully intend to do the same for pretty much everything I ever create on my computer from now on. Other programs, resume, notes...

It's a brave new world.

<sup id="f1">1</sup> <sub>My thoughts on the course itself: It's very much geared toward an audience with zero prior knowledge, which is both a blessing and a curse. A blessing, because by contrast, pretty much every other tutorial on Git in existence is written by people who have trouble seeing the system from the eyes of an absolute beginner. When I was looking for resources a while ago, this tendency drove me absolutely insane. On the other hand, because the material was developed with beginners in mind, the lessons progress very slowly. Sometimes, I have a habit of skipping over tedious parts so I can get to the good stuff (see: my fiction-reading behavior). For this course, however, I forced myself to watch every video without skipping ahead, and I'm probably better off for it. 5 stars, do recommend.</sub>[â†©](#a1)

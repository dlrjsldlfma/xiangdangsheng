###Greetings

All things must start somewhere, and it isn't always pretty. This blog started with me getting prepared to throw my hat in the ring for a 3 month long bootcamp. [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) is a programming bootcamp located in the SOHO neighborhood in NYC. Mentioned there Recursers were encouraged to blog about their projects and experience. "Fuck it," I said to myself, "it can't be that hard."

How wrong I was. 

I started with a quick google search: free blogs. First result was Wordpress(surprise) so I jumped in, started an account, and wrote my first post. All good, right? Well, I needed to be able to post chunks of my code in each blog post and that was proving to be difficult. From what I could tell in order to post code with highlighting I needed a plugin. But to use the plugin I needed to pay for a premium version of Wordpress. Nope. Not gonna happen. I'm sure there is a way to do it for free, but I wanted to try something different. 

Luckily my brother pointed me to a handy tool that allows the use of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). After a lot of trial and error, and some time in Dependency Hell, I found something that works. I might go into detail at some point but for now I'm just happy its working!

###init

The initial goal of this blog is to improve my ability to document the code I write, and the thought process behind it. I will have lots of material to work with in the form of homework from my programming classes. Right now I'm in CSCI 1733 Introduction to Computing and Programming Concepts, using Python 3.0 with [Introduction to Computer Science Using Python: A Computational Problem-Solving Focus](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP002046.html) by [Charles Dierbach](http://triton.towson.edu/~dierbach/). So far the class feels like a review. Last semester I took a very similar class, but that was taught in C++(UHG) where we learned kinda the same stuff. Which is why it makes even more sense to push myself to do this blog. 

And with that I will end my first post in a grand experiment that can only lead to madness and knowledge.

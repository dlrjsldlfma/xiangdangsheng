​And as they did eat, Jesus took bread and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them, and said, Take it, and eat​. Behold, this is for you to do in remembrance of my body; _for as oft as ye do this ye will remember this hour that I was with you._

As often as I take the sacrament I can remember the times when God has been with me.

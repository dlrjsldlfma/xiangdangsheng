I found another quote that hit home the other day, so [I posted it](https://love-of-god-and-of-all-men.github.io/2023/06/14/They-are-aware-and-They-love-you.html). Recently as I've gone throughout my day, I have seen more evidence of God's love. A few times, it's been through quotes such as this. I make the silliest mistakes, yet afterwards, I feel God's love. I know this quote from a prophet of God is true. Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ do know you. They love you. Reach out in prayer and find their goodness. I know you will I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

> To share the gospel effectively, we don’t need to be a gifted orator. We don’t need to know every jot and tittle of gospel doctrine. We don’t need to memorize dozens of scriptures. We don’t even need to be highly educated. Those things help us share our message, but true converting power comes from a humble heart, a vibrant testimony, and an affirming witness from the Holy Ghost.

Elder Quentin L. Cook

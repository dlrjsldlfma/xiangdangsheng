The Book of Mormon is a big deal. At least, that's what the Prophets and Apostles say:

> The Book of Mormon [is] the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man [will] get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.

-- [Joseph Smith](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/introduction?lang=eng)

> Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations, and where is our religion? We have none.

-- [Joseph Smith](https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-of-presidents-of-the-church-ezra-taft-benson/chapter-9-the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion.p18?lang=eng#p17)

> One cannot come to full faith in this latter-day work—and thereby find the fullest measure of peace and comfort in these, our times—until he or she embraces the divinity of the Book of Mormon.

-- [Jeffrey R Holland](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/10/safety-for-the-soul.p19?lang=eng#p18)

> There is a power in the book which will begin to flow into your lives the moment you begin a serious study of the book. 

-- [Pres. Ezra Taft Benson](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion.p28?lang=eng#p27)

Pay attention to that last one. That's why I'm starting this blog.

Each time I read the Book of Mormon, it gets better and better. After a few times through, you start to feel like you know the writers because you're familiar with their story. You see what they in context because you know too well what's happening next. And the verses (even the way chapters) come alive in a way you never imagined possible.

And the reading gets slower and slower. This past year I didn't even make it to Helaman by the time the New Years deadline our stake president set expired. Why? Because there's just _so much_! I'm highlighting and cross-referencing and getting excited about new discoveries in every other verse. It's excruciatingly slow to get through all that. I'm seriously taxing the Gospel Library app to the limit with all my notes:

My Sunday School teachers warned me this would happen. They tried to tell me that repeated reading would turn me into a Book of Mormon nerd. And I laughed. I figured they were talking about people like my English teachers. People whose superpower is reading a whole lot of poignant meaning into a some really boring short story. And then tell you that by making such-and-such a character disabled, the author was _actually_ putting forth a critique of the American Gilded Age society. Like he couldn't just come out and say "This Gilded Age ain't so great."

But I've learned that's the great thing about the Book of Mormon. You don't have to strain and twist the words to read secret meanings between the lines like you do for Hemingway. It's all there in front of you. Once you get familiar with the  Book of Mormon and can see everything in some context, while you read, other verses start popping into your head. Verses you had never thought of being related until just now. Half the time those verses will be linked already for you in the footnotes of the page and you'll wonder why you never looked there before. The other half of the time, there will be not footnotes. And you'll wonder why they're not there already.

That's why I started this blog. To share my thoughts as I stumble across the Book of Mormon. The thoughts and insights that come into my mind that aren't already in the footnotes at the bottom of the page. I doubt I'll post very frequently, and I doubt any of my commentary will be terribly profound. But maybe someone can benefit from it. Also, because my wife is starting to get tired of me keeping her up until midnight excitedly flipping through Nephite history, so I need a new nerd outlet :)

Thanks!

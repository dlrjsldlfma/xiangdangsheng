A guide and outline on steps I've taken to make my tech stack less addictive.

# Introduction 

The year is 2021 and we have a plethora of tools at our disposal to make life more convenient and connected. I was born at an interesting time - old enough to remember dial up internet and floppy disks in the fourth grade, young enough to be a digital native. Smart phones started to become ubiquitous as I became a "real person", beginning to be conscious of the world around me in a real way. The consequences of being a digital native are not understanding what an adult world was like before the convenience of technology. 

The question I ask myself frequently is this: what would my brain be like without all this technology? What would my attention span be like? Would I have less anxiety? What would my days look like without my 90-100 average pickups a day? 

These things I can't know easily, not without leaving my current world. However, I can take a guess - my attention span would be higher, my anxiety would be lower, and I would probably feel a bit better every day. I'm regularly a bit disgusted with how much of my life seems to be wasted by apps and companies trying to monopolize my time, frustratingly without any control or input on my end. 

So, I have started taking steps to distance myself from technology. I've added friction points to guard myself against the slip into addictive patterns. This is a comprehensive guide that I plan on updating as time goes on.

# Computer Adaptations

Phone's are more addictive, but I need to use my laptop daily for my job. I am a proponent of utilizing my work computer as a one-stop shop; in my opinion, maintaining two separate environments is a waste of time. The downside of this is that I can slip into misuse patterns during work that I have developed outside of work.

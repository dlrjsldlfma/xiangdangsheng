A guide and outline on steps I've taken to make my tech stack less addictive. 
<!--excerpt-->

# Introduction 

The year is 2021 and we have a plethora of tools at our disposal to make life more convenient and connected. I was born at an interesting time - old enough to remember dial up internet and floppy disks in the fourth grade, young enough to be a digital native. Smart phones started to become ubiquitous as I became a "real person", beginning to be conscious of the world around me in a real way. The consequences of being a digital native are not understanding what an adult world was like before the convenience of technology. 

The question I ask myself frequently is this: what would my brain be like without all this technology? What would my attention span be like? Would I have less anxiety? What would my days look like without my 90-100 average pickups a day? 

These things I can't know easily, not without leaving my current world. However, I can take a guess - my attention span would be higher, my anxiety would be lower, and I would probably feel a bit better every day. I'm regularly a bit disgusted with how much of my life seems to be wasted by apps and companies trying to monopolize my time, frustratingly without any control or input on my end. 

So, I have started taking steps to distance myself from technology. I've added friction points to guard myself against the slip into addictive patterns. This is a comprehensive guide that I plan on updating as time goes on.

# Framework for Eliminating Addiction Points

# Computer Adaptations

Phone's are more addictive, but I need to use my laptop daily for my job. I am a proponent of utilizing my work computer as a one-stop shop; in my opinion, maintaining two separate environments is a waste of time. The downside of this is that I can slip into misuse patterns during work that I have developed outside of work. The boundaries blend. 

What are the patterns I have sought to eliminate on my computer? Primarily, I'm looking to eliminate mindless patterns: going on Reddit when motivation slips or boredom strikes. I don't care about removing the possibility of any distraction - sometimes I do want to go on Reddit. 

What are my goals here? Primarily, I want to remove *immediate* access from sites that I've identified as dopamine hits, and do my best to block *unwanted* solicitations from these sites. Solicitations are things like ads and feeds. Dopamine hits can really be anything, and require a bit more introspection.

Most of these tools involve Chrome extensions, because I personally use Chrome with a 3rd party search as default. Plenty of articles have been written about the pro's and con's of alternative browsers, such as these [qkz], however I still haven't yet made the jump. 

## Chrome extensions 

1. [BlockSite](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blocksite-block-websites/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh) 

I use blocksite to block certain sites on my work computer. I find that not being able to go on these sites during work has not negatively impacted my life whatsoever. It saves me at least 15 minutes a day that otherwise would've been spent down a rabit hole with no added value for the rest of my life. 

Blocksite is self-explanatory to set up. It also gives the option to re-route from a blocked site to a site of your choice. Mine re-routes to [this website](http://www.minimizedistraction.com/), a presentation by Google employees called "A Call to Minimize Distraction & Respect Users' Attention".

I personally have Reddit blocked, as well as PokemonShowdown.com. I find that these are the two sites I mindless plug in when bored. The first time BlockSite re-routed me from Reddit to the Google Presentation I felt so bamboozled I just got right back to work. 

2. [Unhook](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unhook-remove-youtube-rec/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid) 

Unhook removes YouTube's recommended videos. I can't recommend it enough. Before installing, go and subscribe to any channels you actually care about. 

With Unhook, if you open YouTube to search for something important like a tech tutorial, you won't get distracted away from your objective. If you open YouTube out of boredom, you'll probably just leave and do something else instead. 

3. [News Feed Eradicator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en)

The News Feed Eradicator nixes your Facebook News feed. Personally, I can't bring myself to delete Facebook. Sometimes I get important event invites, and I still use it to check for friends birthdays. I've found that Facebook's algorithm is exceptional at showing you content that you actually care about - if I spend 1-2 weeks off Facebook, when I see my feed again I'm shown a list of actual life updates such as marriages, new jobs, and moves. It doesn't feel like I miss out.

4. [AdBlocker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus-free-ad-bloc/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb) 

I think advertisements are insidious and I try and block as many as I can. If I actually need a novel product, I'm sure that I'll run across it eventually. I don't find myself frequently distracted by ads, but they're designed to catch your eye and they represent an entirely unsolicited distraction. 

## Email and Messaging

Visual distractions fall primarily into the category of solicitations. I've found that some of my best work comes when I have Slack closed out and I'm missing dozens of non-urgent messages. Furthermore, I haven't discerned any real benefit from checking my email every time a new message pops up - with my current job, rarely is a message so important that it can't go more than an hour without being seen. There are some exceptions - doing a deployment/software release/any other "on call" task - however my *default* is always-off.


### Slack

Most organizations use Slack or Teams. I've used both, prefer neither, and find that the settings for any messaging app are pretty granular. Here are the settings I look for. 

1. Removing badges 

I have a compulsive hatred for badges. I find that they are impossible to ignore, which violates my philosophy of batch-checking messages on my own schedule.

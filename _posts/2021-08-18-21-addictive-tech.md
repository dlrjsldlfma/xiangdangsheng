A guide and outline on steps I've taken to make my tech stack less addictive.

# Introduction 

The year is 2021 and we have a plethora of tools at our disposal to make life more convenient and connected. I was born at an interesting time - old enough to remember dial up internet and floppy disks in the fourth grade, young enough to be a digital native. Smart phones started to become ubiquitous as I became a "real person", beginning to be conscious of the world around me in a real way. The consequences of being a digital native are not understanding what an adult world was like before the convenience of technology. 

The question I ask myself frequently is this: what would my brain be like without all this technology? What would my attention span be like? Would I have less anxiety? What would my days look like without my 90-100 average pickups a day? 

I'm regularly a bit disgusted with how much of my life seems to be wasted by apps and companies trying to monopolize my time, a disgust that I have little control over and no input on. So, I have started taking steps to distance myself from technology. I've added friction points to guard myself against the slip into addictive patterns. This is a comprehensive guide that I plan on updating as time goes on.

# Computer Adaptations

Phone's are more addictive, but I need to use my laptop daily for my job. And, since I believe maintaining two separate computer environments is a waste of time, I also use my work computer for most leisure activites (reading the news, watching Netflix, building my personal site). The downside of this dual-usage is that I can slip into misuse patterns during work that I have developed outside of work. The boundaries blend. 

What are the patterns I have sought to eliminate on my computer? Primarily, I'm looking to eliminate mindless patterns: going on Reddit when motivation slips or boredom strikes. I don't care to go so far as to remove any *possibility* of a  distraction - sometimes I do want to go on Reddit. Just not when my primary goal is to get my tasks done for the day.  

What are my goals here? Primarily, I want to remove *immediate* access from sites that I've identified as dopamine hits, and do my best to block *unwanted* solicitations from these sites. Solicitations are things like ads and feeds. Dopamine hits can really be anything, and require a bit more introspection.

Most of these tools involve Chrome extensions, because I personally use Chrome with a 3rd party search as default. Plenty of articles have been written about the pro's and con's of alternative browsers, such as these [qkz], however I still haven't yet made the jump.

# Phone Adaptations 

Most of the detailed instructions here are for iPhone - I've switched between iOS and Android several times, landing on Apple for now mainly due to the social implications of not having iMessage. If you have an Android, these steps will still apply, however the implementation will be a little different.

## Coach Tony's Guide

My first introduction to detailed iPhone modifications for better productivity came from [this BetterHumans article by Coach Tony](https://betterhumans.pub/how-to-set-up-your-iphone-for-productivity-focus-and-your-own-longevity-bb27a68cc3d8). It's a behemoth of a read, but I can't recommend it enough. 

Since first reading it, Coach Tony has added a *lot* of extra information, some of which I find to be personal preference. However, I strongly recommend the first 11 steps in his guide, specifically aimed at "Optimizing Single Tasking".

Some of these steps have changed my relationship with my phone entirely. As I mention at the top, it's important to

### [BlockSite](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blocksite-block-websites/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh) 

I use blocksite to block certain sites on my work computer. I find that not being able to go on these sites during work has not negatively impacted my life whatsoever. It saves me at least 15 minutes a day that otherwise would've been spent down a rabit hole with no added value for the rest of my life. 

Blocksite is self-explanatory to set up. It also gives the option to re-route from a blocked site to a site of your choice. Mine re-routes to [this website](http://www.minimizedistraction.com/), a presentation by Google employees called "A Call to Minimize Distraction & Respect Users' Attention".

I personally have Reddit blocked, as well as PokemonShowdown.com. I find that these are the two sites I mindless plug in when bored. The first time BlockSite re-routed me from Reddit to the Google Presentation I felt so bamboozled I just got right back to work. 

### [Unhook](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unhook-remove-youtube-rec/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid) 

Unhook removes YouTube's recommended videos. I can't recommend it enough. Before installing, go and subscribe to any channels you actually care about.

With Unhook, if you open YouTube to search for something important like a tech tutorial, you won't get distracted away from your objective. If you open YouTube out of boredom, you'll probably just leave and do something else instead. 

### [News Feed Eradicator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en)

The News Feed Eradicator nixes feeds for Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, and a few other apps. Personally, I can't bring myself to delete my social media. Sometimes I get important event invites, and I still use it to check for friends birthdays. I've found that Facebook and Instagram's algorithms are exceptional at showing you content that you actually care about - if I spend 1-2 weeks off Facebook, when I see my feed again I'm shown a list of actual life updates such as marriages, new jobs, and moves. It doesn't feel like I miss out.

### [AdBlocker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus-free-ad-bloc/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb) 

I think advertisements are insidious and I try and block as many as I can. If I actually need a novel product, I'm sure that I'll run across it eventually - I don't need a company sneaking in through my interests to tell me that I need something. I don't find myself distracted by ads, but they're designed to catch your eye and they can still interrupt your train of thought.

## Email and Messaging

Visual distractions fall primarily into the category of solicitations. I've found that some of my best work comes when I have Slack closed out and I'm missing dozens of non-urgent messages. Furthermore, I haven't discerned any real benefit from checking my email every time a new message pops up - with my current job, rarely is a message so important that it can't go more than an hour without being seen. There are some exceptions - doing a deployment/software release/any other "on call" task - however my *default* is always-off.


### Slack/Teams

Most organizations use Slack or Teams. I've used both, prefer neither, and find that the settings for any messaging app are pretty granular. Here are the settings I look for. 
<br>

1. Removing badges 

I have a compulsive hatred for badges. I find that they are impossible to ignore, which violates my philosophy of batch-checking messages on my own schedule.

2. Optimizing Notifications 

My philosophy with notifications is "always-off by default". I think that spending 15 minutes on your notifications settings is worth it in the long run. Here are some example settings from myself 
 - Direct Messages and Mentions show notifications, since these are usually important
 - Most of my slack channels are muted by default.
 - DMs and Mentions still show through muted channels. 

3. Cmd + Q 

I close Slack regularly when I need to get urgent work done. On a Mac, this is as simple as Cmd + Q. Usually when I try and do this I change my Slack status, just in case someone messaging me is expecting an immediate response. **These are my most productive times**

### Email 

My current job at Tempus is extremely low email volume - maybe 15-20 emails on a busy day, nearly all from GitHub. I get 5-10 emails a week from colleagues and Tempus. We use gmail and I have no email strategy because I don't need it. 

My previous job was the opposite - Microsoft Suite, and at least 100 emails a day. This required a different strategy, so I'll talk about it. 

1. Removing all email notifications. 

You simply don't need notifications on email. Ever. Maybe other jobs aren't like this, but in any organization with a messaging service (such as slack), urgent requests are not routed through email. Therefore, I recommend keeping email closed and as un-distracting as possible. Otherwise, you'll end up spending every hour of your job waiting for, then responding to, emails, with no time. For me, I end up compulsively checking email when I'm out of a deep-work state, or right before meetings. If disabling notifications means you forget checking your email, block off 4x15 minutes throughout the day on your calendar to do so. 

2. Clean out your subscriptions.

When I see an email that is unimportant, I take the extra 5 seconds to unsubscribe and block. This pays dividends in the future, and I recommend getting in the habit of keeping your email inbox as sacred of a space as possible. 

3. App Scripts to manage your inbox

If you're using gmail, you can design [custom scripts](https://script.google.com/home) to modify your email inbox in particular ways. This has nothing to do with tech addiction, only ease of use, and is therefore out of the scope of this guide. I can, however, provide an example that I use - 

[PurgeOldEmails](https://gist.github.com/benbjurstrom/00cdfdb24e39c59c124e812d5effa39a) is a script that Ben Bjustrom wrote - it automatically deletes emails that are not flagged/starred/marked as important after one week. I implemented this with a few tweaks and so far have had no problems. 


### Calendar 

Calendar notifications are always-on by design, otherwise your calendar is not very useful. 

On Microsoft Suite, there sadly is not the granularity to distinguish between email notifications and calendar notifications. I chose to disable all notifications at the cost of being late to meetings and sometimes missing them altogether. The upside of this was that any meeting I missed where my presence was actually needed, I would usually get a Direct Message asking where I was, and any meeting I wasn't required at I would miss without any consequence. 

With Google Suite, no notification settings are required.

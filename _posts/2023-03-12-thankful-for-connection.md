Over this past week I was able to connect with my extended family in Idaho. I don't get to see them much because I live in a different state, but I am thankful for technology that brings us closer together.

I am thankful for my phone that can text and call. I am also thankful for technology others have created the various messaging platforms, and FamilySearch where I can record and share my family memories and stories. There are so many ways to connect and get to know each other for which I am thankful.

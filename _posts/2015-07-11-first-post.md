title: First post/Thesis statement

I have a long history of creating blogs and abandoning them for new ones, and I will make no apologies for doing so again. I've done a lot of thinking about what I want this space to be: should I write about my day-to-day life? Record my progress in learning programming? Or use it as a dumping ground for hobbies and ideas? I'm not entirely sure, but I'll leave it open-ended for now, and maybe a theme will emerge over time.

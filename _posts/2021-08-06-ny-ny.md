Month one in the city 
<!--excerpt-->

---

A word to the wise wise - don't start your New York lease on July 1st. And if you do, just don't move in on the first weekend of the month like everyone else. 

As I learned the hard way, July 1st leases just cost more than any other lease. I'm not going to disclose exactly how much I'm paying for rent, but I will say that my dad described it as "similar in size to my mortgage". 

All in all though, I can't complain. We found a dream apartment with an enormous patio, two whole bathrooms *and* a washer/dryer *in unit*! And, overall, our move went smoothly. Tempus gave a generous relocation subsidy that covered movers and a U-haul. So, on the second weekend of July, Bugg and I drove up with all of our possessions and moved in.

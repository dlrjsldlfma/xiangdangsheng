Thursday, I watched it snow, I've been thinking about all of us as people. We are all God's children, each one a snowflake. As I watched the snow falling, I had a thought about how each person, like each snowflake, is unique.

Not even a sparrow falls without God's notice.
[(See Matthew 10:29)](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/10?id=p29&lang=eng#p29)

God must know all the individual snowflakes. Surely He knows _you_ individually. I know He loves you more than anything.

If you don't know this for yourself, I invite you to pray to God and ask Him if He loves you, and listen to the answer. He will answer you just as He has answered me.

Biblical Insights
-----------------

I found a really cool insight that will help me understand the New Testament as I read it this year. I invite you to think about it as well as you review the 4 gospels in the Bible. I will pull it from my church’s New Testament study manual Come, Follow Me.

Who were Matthew and Luke?
--------------------------

Matthew was a Jewish publican, or tax collector, whom Jesus called as one of His Apostles (see Matthew 10:3; see also Bible Dictionary, “Publicans”). Matthew wrote his Gospel mainly to fellow Jews; therefore, he chose to emphasize Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah that were fulfilled through Jesus’s life and ministry.

Luke was a Gentile (non-Jewish) physician who traveled with the Apostle Paul. He wrote his Gospel after the Savior’s death primarily to a non-Jewish audience. He testified of Jesus Christ as the Savior of both the Gentiles and the Jews. He recorded eyewitness accounts of events in the Savior’s life, and he included more stories involving women compared to the other Gospels.

See also Bible Dictionary, “Gospels,” “Matthew,” “Luke.”

Matthew and Luke as well as Mark and John each had something unique to share. How blessed we are to have each account to get to know the Savior a little more. Let us each use our unique talents to share the Savior and His light with others today.

After messing around with github pages for a bit, and following a simple but effective [guide by Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on how to host your first Jekyll site via Github, I decided to play around with a few more themes. 

Barry's guide was great, and I need to give him the kudos he deserves here. He convinced me that anyone with a propensity for coding and hacking should look at Jekyll blogs instead of Wordpress. He's right - how can I blog about data engineering and coding on a blog that I wrote no code for? 

I've moved on since Barry's guide, since I wanted a bit more control over my own theme. I'm still figuring out how to achieve the same URL elegance without buying my own domain name just yet. The theme I'm using is Lanyon -

> Lanyon is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

To be frank, I'm still figuring things out (partly due to an issue with a lack of sudo privileges on my main computer, thanks Deloitte), but I'm confident I'll get there eventually. 

I think this will serve my purposes, at least for now, and I love the bit of Jekyll & Hyde Fanfiction surrounding Jekyll, and the theme I'm using (Lanyon, built on Poole). My knowledge of Jekyll & Hyde is limited to the Runescape quest I did circa the 6th grade, so I think it's time I open up the book for real. 

### Built on Poole

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and every theme built on it (like Lanyon here) includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Lanyon features

In addition to the features of Poole, Lanyon adds the following:

* Toggleable sliding sidebar (built with only CSS) via **â˜°** link in top corner
* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Lanyon is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Lanyon is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!

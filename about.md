I'm a student and Massachusetts native making all sorts of stuff. I've got a Shapeoko 3 CNC router from the folks at [Carbide 3D](https://carbide3d.com/) that drives most of my CNC and woodworking projects. Most of my design work is done in Illustrator and Onshape, with CAM toolpathing in Fusion. On the programming side, I mostly write Swift, Go, and Python, although I'll dip into some C++ for Arduino if the project calls for it.

This [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site runs a modified version of the [Lanyon](https://lanyon.getpoole.com/) theme. My most notable addition is support for dark mode. Try switching your device display preferences between light and dark, and the site should re-render in real time.

Hi, I'm Hunter, a mediocre developer hacking away at hard problems.
I write a lot of JavaScript, bash, markdown, and - lately - Go.

Whenever I figure something out, I write a note to myself so
when I inevitably have the same problem in the future, I'll have a reference.
Though I've been taking local notes for years, I only recently started pushing them to a repo.

Have questions or ideas? Get in touch:

- [github/hunterloftis](https://github.com/hunterloftis)

I also write:

- [Playful JavaScript](http://www.playfuljs.com/)
- [On the Heroku Blog](https://blog.heroku.com/node-habits-2016)

I work with awesome people at [Heroku](https://heroku.com) on the Languages team.

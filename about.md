Hi, I'm Hunter, a mediocre developer hacking away at hard problems.
I live in North Carolina with my fianc√© and two cats.
I work on the Languages team at [Heroku](https://heroku.com),
write a lot of JavaScript, Unity, and Go,
and mostly get away from computers by hiking, sailing, or motorcycling.

Whenever I figure something out, I take a note for future-me.
I've started publishing those notes here. Have questions or ideas? Get in touch:

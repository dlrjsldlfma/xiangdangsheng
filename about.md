Hi, I'm Hunter, a mediocre developer hacking away at hard problems.
I live in North Carolina with [my fianc√©](https://www.amandalenz.io/)
and work remotely for [Heroku](https://heroku.com).
I write a lot of JavaScript, Unity, and Go,
and otherwise get away from my keyboard by hiking and motorcycling.

Instead of saving notes locally, I've started publishing them here,
because maybe you and I make the same mistakes.

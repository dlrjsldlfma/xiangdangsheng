I'm a 2nd year undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Bombay. I'm currently majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm really enthusiastic about computer programming in general. I've dabbled around in lots of fields, ranging from backend web development to competitive programming competitions. I'm also really enthusiastic about security related contests like CTFs and have recently started contributing to the world of open source through [SymEngine](https://github.com/symengine/symengine).

title: About Me
---

Hello all. I'm Joyce Lewis, though some of you may know me better as doublejay9. I spent my childhood moving around every 3 years, but now my family and I have settled in Northern Virginia.

I was that quiet kid who was perfectly content playing with stuffed animals by herself, creating stories for hours. When I was 12, in a moment of severe boredom, I started writing these stories down. I haven't stopped. My friends in high school introduced to fantasy and science fiction, and I quickly became addicted. Today, these are the two genres I primarily write in.

Aside from writing, I enjoy music, video games, astronomy, technology, ancient history, a good cup of hot chocolate, and anything else nerdy. Yeah. I'm one of those curious types who is never without something to entertain herself with.

Thanks for stopping by the blog. I hope you find something interesting or useful here. Come back for more -- I've got a lot of cool plans. Until then, see you around the internet.

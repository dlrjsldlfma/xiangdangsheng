## Why you should get a coach (criteria and reasons):

- Writing your own training plans is time consuming. Having a plan for every day is convenient and efficient. 
- Self-coaching is hard. Even the best coaches will not have luck self coaching, because subjectivity leaks in. Results come from consistency. Consistency is only possible with objective training. 
- A good coach will teach you to be a better athlete, permanently.
